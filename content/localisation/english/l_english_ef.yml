  ef_flavour.10.name: "Into the Deep"
  ef_flavour.10.desc: "Several prominent members of [This.GetName]'s planetary administration have expressed concern over the lack of information about the state of lowest arcology levels.\n\nThey have petitioned the planetary governor to allow an expedition to venture into the deep levels and conduct a survey of the population and the state of the habitation zones."
  ef_flavour.10.a: "An excellent initiative."

  ef_flavour.11.desc: "Our expedition into the deep levels of [This.GetName] has returned with remarkable news; they have encountered entire habitation units unknown to the planetary authorities. What's more they are eager to work!\n\nIt appears that the denizens of the lower levels had been constructing far more than the local governor suspected. Between natural growth and a steady flow of migrants to these new zones, the population of [This.GetName] appears to be larger than the last census would suggest."
  ef_flavour.11.a: "An unforeseen benefit."

  ef_flavour.12.name: "Expedition: Party Wipe"
  ef_flavour.12.desc: "After several months without contact we can only assume that something has gone wrong with our survey team. They have disappeared without a trace in the lower levels.\n\nWe have no way of knowing whether they got lost, ran into gangers or other more dangerous things that lurk in the deep recesses of [This.GetName].\n\nRegardless of their ultimate fate, our survey of the arcologies has been left incomplete and we continue to have major gaps in our knowledge of many of the lowest levels."
  ef_flavour.12.a: "An unfortunate end."

  ef_flavour.13.name: "Expedition: Collapse"
  ef_flavour.13.desc: "The survivors of our expedition into the deep levels of [This.GetName]'s arcologies have returned. They report that the expedition was making good progress until a large section of underground tunnels and residential zones collapsed.\n\nThe cause is unknown, but it could be anything from a gang war gone overboard to a sudden quake caused by the pressure of the buildings above. Regardless, it appears that this small corner of the world city is no more."
  ef_flavour.13.a: "Unfortunate."

  ef_flavour.20.name: "Freighter Crash on [This.GetName]"
  ef_flavour.20.desc: "Tragedy has struck [This.GetName] today as a large freighter broke up in the upper atmosphere, dropping debris and cargo throughout the Southern hemisphere of the planet.\n\nAlthough the falling wreckage has cause some damage, much of it was burned up during the descent.

  ef_flavour.22.desc: "In the years following the devastating freighter crash on [This.GetName] the local authorities have been receiving increasing reports of individuals possessing strange abilities that appear to defy our understanding of physics.\n\nIt appears that exposure to something in the freighter's cargo must have triggered these changes, unlocking some previously unknown aspect of the [Owner.GetSpeciesName] psyche."
  ef_flavour.22.a: "A remarkable outcome."

Interrogations have revealed that they are members of a pre FTL civilization. They claim to have been abducted as slaves by the smugglers and shipped offworld.\n\nWe believe that we can locate their homeworld by examining the smugglers navigation data, but some of the primitives have expressed a desire to remain in our more advanced society, citing poverty and oppression back home."

Machines shut down for nonexistent maintenance cycles and fraudulent database entries have been causing constant disruption across the planet.\n\nThere is little evidence of who the intruders are, but there is enough to form a trail. Somebody with significant capabilities is trying to get into our systems. They have caused serious disruptions in the process."

  ef_flavour.61.name: "Runaway Machines"
  ef_flavour.61.desc: "Chaos erupted on [This.GetName] as computer systems across the planet went haywire, causing a great deal of damage. It seems that the initial cause of the intrusion originated from a disused warehouse in the lower levels of the city.\n\nThe authorities were unable to determine the culprits, but they did discover a crude AI core, bearing significant damage. The perpetrators may have escaped, but their weapon is no longer available."
  ef_flavour.61.a: "Regrettable"

  ef_flavour.62.name: "A Failed Invention"
  ef_flavour.62.desc: "Our investigation on [This.GetName] has borne fruit. It appears that a minor criminal syndicate was attempting to develop a homegrown artificial intelligence.\n\nUnfortunately for the criminals, they were unable to achieve a fully functional intelligence. The program performed poorly and left telltale traces on public systems when used, allowing our investigators to follow the tracks.\n\nAlthough the criminal's work was shoddy, there are some novel solutions they developed that certain members of our scientific community are interested in."

With deliberate outreach programs and sponsorship, we can develop the planet's reputation as a centre of culture and politics in the galaxy.\n\nAs a major source of labour and already well integrated into our logistics networks, [This.GetName] has enormous potential as a manufacturing hub. All it requries is a relatively minor investment.\n\nThe tremendous consumer markets of [This.GetName] have also drawn the attention of numerous conglomerates, who are eager to get their [This.Owner.GetSpeciesHandName]s on the planet's lucrative trade routes."

  ef_trade.21.name: "A Grand Conspiracy"
  ef_trade.21.desc: "Our investigators on [This.GetName] have uncovered evidence of a sweeping conspiracy between major corporate entities and the local government.\n\nNumerous government officials appear to have accepted bribes in exchange for issuing tax reductions or ignoring them outright.\n\nThe most prominent conspirators have been arrested, but the rot appears to have spread deep.

[ef_corrupt_governor.GetName], the planetary governor of [This.GetName] was in collusion with the conspirators!\n\nWe have been presented with undeniable evidence of [ef_corrupt_governor.GetName]'s knowledge of the conspiracy, but it appears that [ef_corrupt_governor.GetHerHis] direct involvement was limited to accepting payments to ignore the problem.\n\nIt may be politically inconvenient to directly charge the governor and perhaps we could arrange for the whole debacle to be swept under the rug."
  ef_trade.22.imprison: "[ef_corrupt_governor.GetName] must go."
  ef_trade.22.leave: "We cannot afford to fire [ef_corrupt_governor.GetHerHim]."

We now possess a comprehensive list of the individuals and entities involved in a grand plan to defraud the planetary government.\n\nAlthough many of the conspirators have been arrested, there are several individuals involved who possess substantial political and financial connections.\n\nWe could proceed with prosecuting these conspirators, but their removal may cause a major disruption in the economy of [This.GetName]."

  ef_trade.30.desc: "A major corporation on [This.GetName] has fallen on hard times recently. One of their biggest competitors has made moves to acquire the failing megacorp, but the potential merger would result in an extremely dominant market share.\n\nSeveral of the competing megacorporations on [This.GetName] have petitioned the government to disallow the merger, claiming that it would result in a de-facto monopoly.

Local authorities are completely overwhelmed."
  ef_trade.51.a: "This is escalating."

  ef_trade.53.name: "Rising Chaos on [Target.GetName]"
  ef_trade.53.desc: "[Target.GetName] has seen a recent string of high profile break-ins and kidnappings. Although primarily concentrated between the rival parties of the planet's growing corporate war, third parties have been increasingly involved.\n\nInvestors and conglomerates have begun to re-evaluate their association with [Target.GetName] in response to the authorities' apparent inability to resolve the crisis."
  ef_trade.53.a: "A worrying trend."

  ef_trade.54.name: "Breakdown of Order"
  ef_trade.54.desc: "The Shadow War on [Target.GetName] has grown completely out of hand. Large areas of the planet have descended into complete lawlessness as local authorities are forced out by heavily armed mercenary groups. A handful of orbital engagements and a constant terror bombing campaign perpetrated by both sides against one another have led to a collapse of the world's economy."

It will take years to rebuild what was destroyed and the victorious conglomerates will be sure to seek their cut."

  ef_trade.56.desc: "Local authorities have succeeded in bringing the Shadow War on [This.GetName] to an end.

Although it will take time, rebuilding efforts have already begun across the planet and investors have found new confidence in the world's prospects."
  ef_trade.56.a: "Peace at last."

  ef_trade.60.desc: "Local authorities on [This.GetName] have, in conjunction with several of the major corporations, arranged a grand summit of local and galactic commercial partners.\n\nWith some of the biggest names in the galaxy sending at least a token representative, this conference represents an excellent opportunity to attract further investment and deals for [This.GetName]."

  ef_trade.61.name: "Prosperity Imminent"
  ef_trade.61.desc: "The trade summit on [This.GetName] has finally come to a close and it has been an unmitigated success.

  ef_trade.62.name: "A Futile Effort"

  ef_trade.62.a: "An unfortunate outcome."

  ef_trade.70.desc: "[This.GetName] is famous for its intense corporate rivalries and cutthroat business practices. However in recent months, this competition has been threatening to grow into something more sinister.\n\nNumerous warehouses and factories in the lower levels have been reporting an uptick in sabotage and mysterious break ins. Suspiciously, these incidents are confined to facilities belonging to two rival corporations.\n\nNaturally, both have blamed the other and have sought the authorities to punish the other party."
  ef_trade.70.a: "We could be "persuaded" to a particular perspective."
  ef_trade.70.b: "It is not our role to interfere."
  ef_trade.70.c: "Crack down on this sort of behaviour."

  ef_trade.71.name: "A Corporate Reconciliation"
  ef_trade.71.desc: "Our firm response on [This.GetName] appears to have been heeded. Incidents of sabotage and burglary have returned to normal levels.\n\nWhile the two rival corporations continue to compete, they appear to be content to keep their rivalry in the commercial sphere alone."
