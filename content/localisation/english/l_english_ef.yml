  ef_flavour.10.name: "Into the Deep"
  ef_flavour.10.desc: "Several prominent members of [This.GetName]'s planetary administration have expressed concern over the lack of information about the state of lowest arcology levels.\n\nThey have petitioned the planetary governor to allow an expedition to venture into the deep levels and conduct a survey of the population and the state of the habitation zones."
  ef_flavour.10.a: "An excellent initiative."
  ef_flavour.10.b: "It would be too dangerous."

  ef_flavour.11.name: "Expedition: New Zones"
  ef_flavour.11.desc: "Our expedition into the deep levels of [This.GetName] has returned with remarkable news; they have encountered entire habitation units unknown to the planetary authorities. What's more they are eager to work!\n\nIt appears that the denizens of the lower levels had been constructing far more than the local governor suspected. Between natural growth and a steady flow of migrants to these new zones, the population of [This.GetName] appears to be larger than the last census would suggest."
  ef_flavour.11.a: "An unforeseen benefit."

  ef_flavour.12.name: "Expedition: Party Wipe"
  ef_flavour.12.desc: "After several months without contact we can only assume that something has gone wrong with our survey team. They have disappeared without a trace in the lower levels.\n\nWe have no way of knowing whether they got lost, ran into gangers or other more dangerous things that lurk in the deep recesses of [This.GetName].\n\nRegardless of their ultimate fate, our survey of the arcologies has been left incomplete and we continue to have major gaps in our knowledge of many of the lowest levels."
  ef_flavour.12.a: "An unfortunate end."

  ef_flavour.13.name: "Expedition: Collapse"
  ef_flavour.13.desc: "The survivors of our expedition into the deep levels of [This.GetName]'s arcologies have returned. They report that the expedition was making good progress until a large section of underground tunnels and residential zones collapsed.\n\nThe cause is unknown, but it could be anything from a gang war gone overboard to a sudden quake caused by the pressure of the buildings above. Regardless, it appears that this small corner of the world city is no more."
  ef_flavour.13.a: "Unfortunate."

  ef_flavour.20.name: "Freighter Crash on [This.GetName]"
  ef_flavour.20.desc: "Tragedy has struck [This.GetName] today as a large freighter broke up in the upper atmosphere, dropping debris and cargo throughout the Southern hemisphere of the planet.\n\nAlthough the falling wreckage has cause some damage, much of it was burned up during the descent. Casualties are relatively light, but it appears that freighter was carrying a large quantity of hazardous materials for a major research laboratory on [This.GetName]. We have no idea what the effect of these substances will be on the planet's enviroment."

Although the toxic contamination should naturally disappear over time, its harmful legacy is here to stay."

Interrogations have revealed that they are members of a pre FTL civilization. They claim to have been abducted as slaves by the smugglers and shipped offworld.\n\nWe believe that we can locate their homeworld by examining the smugglers navigation data, but some of the primitives have expressed a desire to remain in our more advanced society, citing poverty and oppression back home."

  ef_flavour.60.name: "Ghost in the System"
  ef_flavour.60.desc: "Irregularities have begun to crop up on the computer systems of [This.GetName]. Machines shut down for nonexistent maintenance cycles and fraudulent database entries have been causing constant disruption across the planet.\n\nThere is little evidence of who the intruders are, but there is enough to form a trail. Somebody with significant capabilities is trying to get into our systems. They have caused serious disruptions in the process."
  ef_flavour.60.a: "This requires a full investigation immediately."
  ef_flavour.60.b: "Wait and see what happens."

  ef_flavour.61.name: "Runaway Machines"
  ef_flavour.61.desc: "Chaos erupted on [This.GetName] as computer systems across the planet went haywire, causing a great deal of damage. It seems that the initial cause of the intrusion originated from a disused warehouse in the lower levels of the city.\n\nThe authorities were unable to determine the culprits, but they did discover a crude AI core, bearing significant damage. The perpetrators may have escaped, but their weapon is no longer available."
  ef_flavour.61.a: "Regrettable"

  ef_flavour.62.name: "A Failed Invention"
  ef_flavour.62.desc: "Our investigation on [This.GetName] has borne fruit. It appears that a minor criminal syndicate was attempting to develop a homegrown artificial intelligence.\n\nUnfortunately for the criminals, they were unable to achieve a fully functional intelligence. The program performed poorly and left telltale traces on public systems when used, allowing our investigators to follow the tracks.\n\nAlthough the criminal's work was shoddy, there are some novel solutions they developed that certain members of our scientific community are interested in."
  ef_flavour.62.a: "Scrap it."
  ef_flavour.62.b: "Allow our researchers to examine it."

  ef_path.1.name: "[This.GetName] at the Crossroads"
  ef_path.1.desc: "As [This.GetName] grows in size and influence, more and more talent is being attracted to the bustling world. We have a unique opportunity to reap the benefits of specialisation by encouraging a particular path of development.\n\nAs one of the galaxy's greatest population centres, [This.GetName] naturally has a great deal of cultural weight. With deliberate outreach programs and sponsorship, we can develop the planet's reputation as a centre of culture and politics in the galaxy.\n\nAs a major source of labour and already well integrated into our logistics networks, [This.GetName] has enormous potential as a manufacturing hub. All it requries is a relatively minor investment.\n\nThe tremendous consumer markets of [This.GetName] have also drawn the attention of numerous conglomerates, who are eager to get their [This.Owner.GetSpeciesHandName]s on the planet's lucrative trade routes."
  ef_path.1.a: "[This.GetName] has the potential to become a centre of galactic affairs."
  ef_path.1.a.tooltip: "Unlocks the §BPolitics§! special effects\n\n§RThis decision is permanent§!"
